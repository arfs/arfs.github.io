                    # Customer Data ETL

                    ---

                    M2M's implementation for the first phase of email marketing

                    | | | |
                    |-|-|-|
                    |**1**|**Collect customer data**|**Customer Data ETLs**|
                    |2|Use the data to create an audience|M2M UI|
                    |3|Prepare an email list|Decision Management Engine|

                    ---

                    We collect data about customers so we can later use the data to target  a specific audience.

                    ---

                    ## Data feeds

                    Collected data is later compiled to one or more feeds which then allows other systems to received updated data, delivered on a recurring basis (daily, weekly, etc.)

                    ![](https://mermaid.ink/svg/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggTFJcbiAgICBjZChDdXN0b21lciBEYXRhKSAtLT58Y29tcGlsZWQgdG98IGZmKEZlZWQgRmlsZSlcbiAgICBmZiAtLT58ZGVsaXZlcmVkIHRvfCBNMk0iLCJtZXJtYWlkIjp7InRoZW1lIjoibmV1dHJhbCJ9LCJ1cGRhdGVFZGl0b3IiOmZhbHNlLCJhdXRvU3luYyI6dHJ1ZSwidXBkYXRlRGlhZ3JhbSI6ZmFsc2V9)

                    ---

                    ### Feed File 

                    Usually some plain text format.  
                    Examples: JSON, XML, delimited file

                    ```
                    ECI,EMAIL
                    1111,customer1111@gmail.com
                    2222,customer2222@hotmail.com
                    3333,customer3333@yahoo.com
                    ```
                    <small>sample feed file with 3 records in CSV format</small>

                    ---

                    ### Problem

                    An automated email marketing platform *could* use the feed file directly.

                    But as the number of customers get larger, what's wrong with working off a large CSV file? 

                    ---

                    #### Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) 

                    General procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source


                    ---

                    #### M2M ETL summary

                    ![](https://mermaid.ink/svg/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggTFJcbiAgICBkZWxpbWl0ZWQoRGVsaW1pdGVkIEZpbGUpIC0tPnxFVEx8IGRiX3RhYmxlKERhdGFiYXNlIFRhYmxlKVxuIiwibWVybWFpZCI6eyJ0aGVtZSI6Im5ldXRyYWwifSwidXBkYXRlRWRpdG9yIjpmYWxzZSwiYXV0b1N5bmMiOnRydWUsInVwZGF0ZURpYWdyYW0iOmZhbHNlfQ)

                    - create database table with number of columns that matches CSV one-to-one
                    - attempt to copy each record into the database table
                    - prune out invalid data while we're at it

                    <small>Result: allows us to query the data faster for targeting</small>

                    ---

                    ### Another Problem

                    What happens when we get a feed file with more or less columns that we expected from last time?

                    ---

                    #### Solution 

                    We have to update our database table to match the new number of columns

                    ---

                    ### Oh no, more problems

                    What happens if any given time, we get different versions of the feed file? 

                    And the number of columns can be vary among the versions? 

                    ---

                    #### Solution 

                     we have to come up with a system where we can
                     
                    - determine what version of the feed file we're getting
                    - create the right version of our database table with the right amount of columns
                    - and the column data in the same order to match the feed file

                    ---

                    ### Feed Versions

                    - problem we had to solve for Chase
                    - more on this in detail later

                    ---

                    ### Bad data

                    What are different ways we can handle bad data?

                    ```
                    ECI,EMAIL,DAYS_ENROLLED
                    1111,customer1111@gmail.com,abc
                    2222,bad3ma1l,5
                    invalid_customer_id,customer3333@yahoo.com,10
                    ```

                    ---

                    #### Error handling strategies

                    - zero out a column value
                    - null out a column value
                    - reject entire row
                    - reject the entire feed 

                    ```
                    ECI,EMAIL,DAYS_ENROLLED
                    1111,customer1111@gmail.com,abc
                    2222,bad3ma1l,5
                    invalid_customer_id,customer3333@yahoo.com,10
                    ```

                    Note:
                    Explain how we reject based on % diff from previous file. 
                    If a feed file looks drastically different from a previous day, most likely something is wrong.
                    ---

                    ## Customer data feed files

                    |feed name|recurrence|
                    |-|-|
                    |target_customer|weekly|
                    |target_product|daily|
                    |personal_customer|daily|
                    |personal_product|daily|

                    <small>*daily means weekdays only</small>

                    ---

                    ### target_customer

                    Contains non personally identifiable information (PII) about a customer's behavior and other attributes about them with respect to Chase.

                    ---

                    It contains data such as:

                    - how many times a customer has logged in the last 90 days
                    - what their credit card status is
                    - whether or not they have bill pay enabled
                    - their enterprise customer identifier (ECI)
                    - much, much more...

                    ---

                    #### Enterprise Customer Identifier

                    Unique identifier for a single customer. Used in every feed file Chase delivers to us to tie in and reference the same customer.

                    ---

                    ### target_product

                    Contains non PII about which Chase products/services a customer is enrolled to.

                    ---

                    Chase has several products/services distributed over many Lines of Businesses (LOB). 

                    |Line of Business|Product Name|
                    |-|-|
                    |Card|Chase Sapphire|
                    |Auto| Chase Auto Loan / Lease|
                    |Mortgage| Chase Home Lending|
                    |Retail|Chase Merchant Services|

                    Note: M2M email campaigns are focused primarily on these four LOBs

                    ---

                    For each product a customer is enrolled to, there's also data such as:

                    - how long they have been enrolled to that product
                    - whether or not paperless statements are enabled
                    - several flags indicating what kind of emails the customer has opted into

                    Note: 
                    Explain how many of the columns in a feed file are probably intentionally obfuscated so it cannot be easily determined what the data represents.

                    ---

                    ### personal_customer

                    Contains **PII** about the customer which are typically used to personalize emails sent to them.

                    - first and last name
                    - email address
                    - language preferences
                    - etc.

                    ---

                    ### personal_product

                    Contains **PII** about the products that the customer are enrolled to which are also typically used to personalize sent to them.

                    - reward points balance
                    - last 4 digits of their account number
                    - credit limit
                    - etc.

                    ---
