    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this challenge I figured we could dive into some actual code and get everyone’s feet wet.</p><p>In <a href="/2018/11/05/thoughts-on-challenge-1/" title="Thoughts on Challenge #1">Thoughts on Challenge #1</a> I talked about the need for instructions to be written in a specific way or else it might be produce different results from what was expected.</p><p>The <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/91330c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code sample</a> provided in the challenge demonstrated this a little bit. </p><h1 id="On-Question-1"><a href="#On-Question-1" class="headerlink" title="On Question 1"></a>On Question 1</h1><blockquote><p>Do you notice anything a little off about the code’s output in relation to the actual lines of code? And whatever you are noticing, why do you think it’s doing that? </p></blockquote><p>90% of the participants noticed that there was some difference in the commands being used in the lines of code. In this case, <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> specifically printed out the text AND added a new line while <code>Console.Write()</code> did not. It’s a minor difference but it does illustrate the need to be a specific.</p><p>And just for shiz and giggles, I threw in <code>\n</code> in there which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape character</a> and an alternate way to produce a new line.</p><h1 id="On-Question-2"><a href="#On-Question-2" class="headerlink" title="On Question 2"></a>On Question 2</h1><blockquote><p>Now pick any of the lines that has a semicolon at the end and remove the semicolon. Click the “Run” button to run the updated code. What happened? Why do you think it’s doing that?</p></blockquote><p>As everyone observed, the program threw an error because it requires you to write your instructions in a certain format a.k.a. <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntax</a>.</p><p>In this case, the syntax requires that you end your individual instructions with a semicolon, much like how we end our sentences with a period.</p><p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syntax</a> is something that all languages have such as this English language you are reading. Speaking of languages, you may have noticed that the <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/91330c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code sample</a> looked a little bit like English, but kind of not.</p><p>That’s because the program was written in a high-level <em>programming language</em> called C# which was designed to be more human readable, but still follows a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntax</a> that a computer can interpret (even now, normal English is still really hard for computers to understand &mdash;just talk to Siri for reference).</p><h1 id="On-Question-3"><a href="#On-Question-3" class="headerlink" title="On Question 3"></a>On Question 3</h1><blockquote><p>How could lines 7 to 12 have been written in one line?</p></blockquote><p>There was a little bit of misintepretation from this question but some participants identified one way of condensing the code into one line by using <code>\n</code> (scroll to the right to see the entire thing)</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, fellow coder!\n Thanks for participating in these challenges.\n I was aiming for these challenges to only take about 10-15 minutes.\n It is a work in progress so sorry if the first one took longer!\n I hope to keep seeing you on the next challenges.&quot;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>But another way of condensing the code into one line is by literaly just putting all of them in one line.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, fellow coder!&quot;); Console.WriteLine(&quot;Thanks for participating in these challenges.&quot;); Console.Write(&quot;I was aiming for these challenges to only take about 10-15 minutes.&quot;); Console.Write(&quot;It is a work in progress so sorry if the first one took longer!\n&quot;); Console.Write(&quot;I hope to keep seeing you on the next challenges.&quot;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This still works because as you learned in Question 2, the syntax for C# only needs a semicolon to distinguish between instructions. However, I <strong>do not</strong> recommend that you ever write code this way since it’s much less readable.</p><h1 id="Bonus-Fact"><a href="#Bonus-Fact" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Fact"></a>Bonus Fact</h1><p>A long time ago people had to write programs in a low-level programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly</a> where an equivalent <code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</code> would look something like this.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mov  dx, msg </span><br><span class="line">mov  ah, 9   </span><br><span class="line">int  0x21</span><br><span class="line">mov  ah, 0x4c </span><br><span class="line">int  0x21 </span><br><span class="line">msg  db &apos;Hello, World!&apos;, 0x0d, 0x0a, &apos;$&apos;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Count your blessings we don’t have to code in that anymore :)</p>]]></content>

You have to do exactly what you did in the challenge and take it a step even further. </p><p>For example, here’s an example from your peers which I was thought reasonably detailed:</p><ol><li>Grab 2 slices of bread</li><li>Place one slice of bread flat</li><li>Get a slice of turkey and “layer” it flat on the slice of bread</li><li>Repeat until 5 total slices of turkey are layered on the piece of bread</li><li>Place a piece of pepper jack cheese of the top</li><li>Spread mayonnaise evenly using a knife in a back and forth motion on the flat side of the other slice of bread</li><li>Place the slice of bread with the mayonnaise facing downward (toward the cheese) on the stack of cheese, turkey, and bread</li><li>Enjoy sandwich.</li></ol><p>Looks pretty good right? Unfortunately a computer might respond like this:</p><blockquote><p>what is grab? what is bread?</p></blockquote><p>So how detailed do you have to be? Maybe something like this:</p><ol><li>Describe what bread is (that white fluffy looking thing over there with light brown edges)</li><li>Describe what a plate is (that round, white flat thing with edges that curve up) </li><li>Take your hand and open it so the fingers are apart</li><li>Move hand towards the bread and touch it with your fingers</li><li>When fingers are touching the bread, close hand by moving fingers together and make sure that some of the bread remains between the fingers</li><li>If you lift your hands up, the bread should move with your hands </li><li>Now move your hands towards the plate until it’s directly on top of it by about 2-3 inches</li><li>Do something similar from #2 so the bread drops on to the plate</li></ol><p>Yes, computer programming is something like this.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Get More Out of Your 1-1s as a Manager</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/images/1-1s.jpg"><p>When I first became a manager and started doing 1–1s, it didn’t feel like a good use of time.</p><p>I was doing them how some of my previous managers were doing them, which was about once a month or so. Since my bosses at the time and I rarely talked, the conversations were somewhat awkward and we’d quickly move on to status updates and perfomance feedback.</p><p>Even for the ones that were more structured and had a prepared agenda, it was strictly informational and they could have easily gotten what they were looking for via email. Sometimes  the meetings felt like a to-do item — just something to check off as part of the duties for the month.</p><p>They weren’t using 1–1s as effectively as they could and I was unfortunately on the path to making the same mistake. But then I realized: hmm… maybe it could be done better. </p><p>Since you’re still reading, I’m assuming you can relate to some or all of this. So let me ask you, have you ever wondered: how can I use my 1–1s more effectively so that I could build engaged, high-performing teams? </p><p>I wondered it myself at one point so I figured I would save you the trouble and share you my thoughts.</p><h1 id="Don’t-Make-It-Just-a-Status-Update"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Just-a-Status-Update" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Just a Status Update"></a>Don’t Make It Just a Status Update</h1><p>Although 1–1s are a good time to get an update on how projects are coming along, one of the things I realized is that it shouldn’t be its only purpose. </p><p>1–1s are a perfect opportunity to make sure that you’re aligned with your team. The mindset coming into one should be about building trust and strong relationships with each individual and making sure there are no obstacles to their success personally or professionally.</p><p>When you have this goal in mind, the conversations should starting feeling less awkward, cold, and impersonal. It should become the start of something… magical. Just kidding. But seriously, it would be much better than before.</p><h1 id="Have-It-More-Frequently"><a href="#Have-It-More-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="Have It More Frequently"></a>Have It More Frequently</h1><p>So let’s forget about work for a second and think about something.</p><p>Do you generally have stronger relationships with people you talk to once a month? Or once a week? I’m hoping you answered once  a week. </p><p>Although it is possible to establish strong relationships with people you talk to infrequently, it is definitely much easier (and quicker) when you talk to them more frequently.</p><p>Yet, there are many managers who choose to have their 1–1s once a month or even worse, quarterly. Since they haven’t been able to establish a relationship with their team members, that blocked-off time becomes an awkward conversation of old status updates and trying to recollect issues that have long passed.</p><p>I like to have 1–1s as suggested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Manager-Mark-Horstman/dp/1119244609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Effective Manager</a> (great book btw) which is to schedule shorter, but more frequent sessions. For me, this was 20 minutes with each team member once a week which I thought was a great cadence for getting to know people well and have very good awareness of what’s going on.</p><p>If you’re in the same office together 40 hours a week, managers should aim to stop simulating the conditions of a long-distance relationship.</p><h1 id="Feedback-Can-Be-Positive-Ya-Know"><a href="#Feedback-Can-Be-Positive-Ya-Know" class="headerlink" title="Feedback Can Be Positive, Ya Know"></a>Feedback Can Be Positive, Ya Know</h1><p>Giving feedback to team members is an important part of making sure everything is on track and making sure they are aware of expectations. </p><p>However, if the feedback given is always negative feedback they will be conditioned to think that it’s the only thing you ever notice — something that’s not good for trust, respect, and/or morale.</p><p>Another thing I like that is suggested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Manager-Mark-Horstman/dp/1119244609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Effective Manager</a> is to occasionally mix in giving ONLY positive feedback in a 1–1 session, especially when you’re first starting off and establishing a relationship. Whether you are giving positive or negative feedback I also like to ask for permission first.</p><ul><li>Do you mind if I share some feedback with you?</li></ul><p>By asking, it prepares the other person to accept feedback more openly or opt-out if they are having a rough day. People like having choices.</p><h1 id="Don’t-Make-It-Just-About-Work"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Just-About-Work" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Just About Work"></a>Don’t Make It Just About Work</h1><p>While we’re talking about establishing relationships, let’s ponder another question. When you meet up with your friends, do you only talk about work? </p><p>I hope not. I would hope that you engage in conversation about other topics such as what’s new with them, what their goals are, etc. </p><p>Likewise, during 1–1s with your team members don’t view them just as employees but rather as real human beings— you know, just like your human friends. Ask about what’s going on with their lives, how they are feeling, and what their problems are. Show genuine interest in them as a person.</p><p>Not only does this establish a relationship, but knowing about their personal life can also help you address anything that might be affecting their professional life. I personally like to start off the 1–1 with this type of conversation first before moving on to work-related items like status updates and feedback.</p><h1 id="Improve-Them-Improve-Yourself"><a href="#Improve-Them-Improve-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Improve Them, Improve Yourself"></a>Improve Them, Improve Yourself</h1><p>In my opinion, the fastest way to grow and advance is by learning from other people. </p><p>If you want your team to be as productive as possible, you should manage for performance <em>and</em> also mentor for development. During your 1–1s, you should pick their brains, coach them to emphasize their strengths,  and help them work around their weaknesses.</p><p>Learning doesn’t have to be a one-way street, however. You might be their boss but it doesn’t mean you have nothing to learn from them. The opposite is true and even more so if your team is a blend of people with different characteristics. Additionally, you <em>should</em> be trying to surround yourself with people that are smarter than you.</p><p>Since you’re already meeting up for 1–1s, why not take advantage of the situation and learn something by engaging in deep, collaborative conversations?</p><p>For example you could</p><ol><li>Ask them how they would approach a problem you have thought about and compare the solutions and thought processes.</li><li>Pick a quality they have that you like or a skill you know they’re good at, then ask them for advice on how to acquire it.</li><li>Get feedback from them, and in particular, solicit negative feedback. Throw away your pride and ask if there’s anything you can do better as a manager and as a person.</li></ol><p>Not only are you using your 1–1 time to learn and improve yourself, but you are also establishing trust and relationships at the same time. </p><p>Learning from other people gives you valuable information about how their mind works, what motivates them, and a bunch of other things that can be leveraged so that you can become not just a good manager, but a good leader as well.</p><h1 id="Engaged-High-Performing-Teams"><a href="#Engaged-High-Performing-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Engaged, High-Performing Teams"></a>Engaged, High-Performing Teams</h1><p>When I realized that I could get more out of my 1–1s by shifting my purpose to building trust and strong relationships, the difference was night and day. </p><p>I started having real conversations — stimulating back and forth dialogue — that was meaningful and productive. Both parties frequently walked away feeling like they learned something new, personally and professionally. Since we learned about each other, we also learned how to work better together and the team’s productivity increased overall.</p><p>By using the time scheduled for 1–1s more effectively, you can transition from something that feels like a to-do item to check off for the month to something that builds engaged, high-performing teams.</p><hr><p><em>Do you have any tips for getting more out of your 1-1s? Please let me know in the comments section below!</em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/images/complex-skills.jpg"><p>Most people have trouble acquiring new complex skills (such as playing tennis, coding, networking, presenting, etc.) because </p><ol><li>they don’t understand that complex skills are really a collection of simple skills performed in a certain manner and…</li><li>it must be practiced repeatedly to make it look easy and natural (internalization)</li></ol><p>A common mistake people make is to try to learn a complex skill as if it’s just one single skill. Through a lot trial and error, it is possible to reach a certain level of competence this way, but I would argue that this common approach introduces a few critical problems.</p><h1 id="Problems-with-the-common-approach"><a href="#Problems-with-the-common-approach" class="headerlink" title="Problems with the common approach"></a>Problems with the common approach</h1><p>The first is that the common approach can take much longer than necessary. For example, many people learn to play tennis simply by going out to the court with friends and try to keep a rally going. If you’ve ever watched casual players do this you would know that it’s not very successful.</p><p>Second is that even if you managed to reach some level of competence with the “trial by fire” approach, the focus would have been on trying to produce “quick” results rather than mastery of fundamentals. Although it is possible to look like you are producing results very quickly on the first part of the learning curve, you are most likely hindering long-term growth by unknowingly having gaps in fundamental knowledge.</p><h1 id="Progressions"><a href="#Progressions" class="headerlink" title="Progressions"></a>Progressions</h1><p>As I mentioned before, complex skills are really a collection of simple skills. A good coach (or a good self-learner) is able to deconstruct these complex skills into simple skills and plan a good sequence of progressions for learning. </p><p>For example, an adult can learn how to ride simply by going out there and immediately trying to pedal on the street and falling repeatedly until they finally get it.</p><p>Or they can take a less painful (and a more effective) approach and learn it through a series of progressions. It can look something like this:</p><ul><li>find a grassy area that has a very slight decline so that a bike can roll downhill</li><li>remove pedals so that it’s not in the way, and try to roll down hill very slowly by inching your feet off the ground just a tad. if you lose balance, just put your feet back down</li><li>as you start to “get” the feel of how the bike starts self-balancing when it’s rolling, try to keep your feet off the ground longer and longer and roll downhill without touching</li><li>as you get better at balancing, switch from a grassy decline to a concrete decline and practice feeling out the balance more</li><li>one you reach a certain level of confidence in your ability to feel the balance, put the pedals back on and attempt to roll down hill with the feet on your pedals (but not pedaling yet)</li><li>after you’re able to keep your balance indefinitely with the feet on the pedals, slowly start moving the pedals with your feet</li><li>etc…</li></ul><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>As you can see from above, the complex skill of learning how to ride a bike has been broken down into more manageable skill progressions.</p><p>Not only is it less overwhelming, but it is actually more effective in that allows a person to master fundamental layers individually so that in creates a strong foundation for long-term growth.</p><p>Most people don’t bother with trying to learn with this approach. The human mind is inherently lazy after all, and it takes some thought via problem solving and planning (or finding/paying for a mentor) to learn in this manner.</p><p>However if you can get over the obstacle of “learning how to learn”, it establishes a framework for learning other complex skills that can open many opportunities.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/images/businesses.jpg"><h1 id="Core-Drives"><a href="#Core-Drives" class="headerlink" title="Core Drives"></a>Core Drives</h1><p>For whatever reason, we exist; and during that existence we have core human drives. We are born with simple and essential ones, such as the need to survive. Out of that comes the need for air, water, and food. As our essential drives are fulfilled and our minds mature, we have the need to fulfill more sophisticated, higher-level drives. We then pursue things such as the need for relatedness, growth, and importance.</p><h1 id="Problems-and-Solutions"><a href="#Problems-and-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Problems and Solutions"></a>Problems and Solutions</h1><p>As you can imagine, those core human drives pose problems for us in our day-to-day lives. For example if our core human drive to survive gives us the problem of hunger, we have to craft a solution in order to fulfill that drive. If we have the desire, time, and resources then our solution can be to obtain the knowledge on how to produce our own food.</p><p>However, time is a finite resource and taking the time to obtain the knowledge to fulfill every drive we have is not a practical solution for most people. In the old days, we obtained solutions from other people by bartering. Nowadays, solutions to our problems can be bought from other people.</p><h1 id="Value"><a href="#Value" class="headerlink" title="Value"></a>Value</h1><p>Our existence gives us core human drives and those drives produce problems that we have to seek solutions for. Since knowledge takes time to obtain and time is finite, we find value in obtaining solutions created by other people. In order to buy solutions, there has to be people creating value and offering them in exchange for currency.</p><h1 id="Businesses"><a href="#Businesses" class="headerlink" title="Businesses"></a>Businesses</h1><p>Businesses are a collection of people creating solutions we find valuable. They deliver it in the form of products and services in exchange for currency.</p><p>Therefore, businesses exist for two reasons:</p><ol><li>to solve problems caused by our core human drives</li><li>ironically enough, to solve the problem of the owner’s own drive to pursue the need for relatedness, growth, and importance.</li></ol><p>Successful businesses are a collection of people proficient in reverse engineering particular inner workings of the human mind.</p>]]></content>
