						# Intro to M2M
					
						---

						## What is the M2M project?

						A custom platform built for JPMC to do automated email marketing.

						---						
						
						## What is marketing?

						---

						Marketing is the process of getting people interested in your company's product or service.

						---
							
						## Traditional Marketing

						- billboards
						- radio/tv ads
						- snail mail

						---

						## Digital Marketing

						- social media
						- website content
						- omnichannel marketing (email, SMS, etc.)
						
						---

						Mentioned earlier, M2M is focused on automated email marketing.

						---

						## Manual Email Marketing
						But first, let's explore the world of manual email marketing.

						---

						### Scenario: You created an awesome alcoholic beverage.
						You want to tell people about it via email. 

						What do you need to have in order to do this?

						---

						### First things first: Get list of emails

						How do you get a list of emails to begin with?

						---

						### Ways to get emails

						- collect it yourself
						- pay someone to give you a list

						assemble it in a spreadsheet or something

						---

						### Next up: Send an email blast to everyone

						But... what problems might you run into when you do this?

						---

						### Problems

						- people not qualified for your product might get an email about it
							- non-drinkers
							- underage
						- someone might report you as spam
						- might get complaint about soliciting minors!

						How to solve those problems?

						---

						### Solutions

						- supplement your email list with data about the customer (age and drinking status)
						- for next email blast, use that new data to hand pick only qualified customers (older than 21 and a drinker)


						---

						BTW... hand picking those customers is what you call creating a segment or audience

						(aka segmentation, targeting, etc.)

						---

						### Another problem

						- people are more likely to respond to an email if it seems like it's just for them
						- what are problems with trying to personalize emails manually?

						---

						### What Next? Track those emails

						Why would we track them? 

						---

						Reminder: goal of the emails is to eventually land a sale of your product

						---

						### Manually tracking email activity

						- respond to people who actually email you back (aka engaging)
						- follow up with them after a certain amount of time 
						- remove people who say they don't want your email! (aka opting out)

						Problems with doing all this manually?

						---
						
						### Making sense of all the activity
						
						If you want to be smart about it, you might want to prepare a report to analyze trends with your emails.
						
						---

						### Email Marketing Phases
						1. Collect customer data 
						2. Use the data to create an audience
						3. Prepare an email list
						4. Send the emails
						5. Track email activity
						6. Generate reports for activity data

						---

						The 6 phases are the foundation of all automated email marketing solutions including M2M project.

						---

						# Automated Email Marketing

						---

						## Collect customer data

						companies collect data about customers every chance they can get

						- sign up forms
						- website/app/email tracking
						- surveys
						
						---
						
						Data is eventually compiled to a feed 

						(more on this later)

						---

						## Use the data to create an audience

						Data is loaded up in one or more databases. Platform has friendly user interface that allows you to get a list of customers that match a criteria (querying, segmentation, targeting).

						---

						## Preparing the email list

						After segmentation, there's additional work to be done
						- deduplication
						- exclude customers for various factors
							- customers who no longer want to receive emails
							- customers who have received an email already
							- etc
							
						---

						## Send the emails

						Platforms usually have a mechanism for actually delivering the emails with a specific template that can also populate placeholders to personalize the email.

						---

						## Track email activity

						Platforms also have the ability to track various statistics about the emails that were sent
						- were they successfully delivered?
						- were they opened?
						- how many failed?
						- etc. 

						---

						## Generate reports for activity data

						All that data would be useless if there was no way to review them via reports. Making sense of the data could be used to improve engagement with the emails.


						---

						# Back to M2M Project

						This is how the different modules of the M2M project fit into the 6 phases we just discussed.

						---

						||Phase|Module|
						|-|-|-|
						|1|Collect customer data|M2M: Customer Data ETLs|
						|2|Use the data to create an audience|M2M UI|
						|3|Prepare an email list|M2M: Decision Management|

						---

						||Phase|Module|
						|-|-|-|
						|4|Send the emails|PCM: Deployments|
						|5|Track email activity|PCM: Activity Data|
						|6|Generate reports for activity data|M2M: Reporting|
						
						---

						M2M is built on top of PeopleCloud Messaging (PCM), formerly known as Harmony.
						
						Note: Can mention that PCM is an Email Service Provider (ESP).

						## What did we learn?

						- What the M2M project is
						- Recap of marketing strategies and why we market
						- Phases of email marketing
						- How M2M modules fit into those phases
